# Java Abstraction

The `abstract` keyword is a **java modifier** applicable for **classes** and **methods** but **not for variables**.

- **An abstract class** is a restricted class that cannot be instantiated. It must be inherited from another class
- **An abstract method** is a method that is declared without an implementation (without brackets `{}`) and can only be used in abstract classes. Its implementation is provided by the subclass (inherited from)
